Description: Door Locker Security System  
Date       : 11/2023
****************************************************************
Project Overview :
1) The system checks if a password was created before and if not it asks the user to create one.
2) The password is saved and will not be lost even if the power is cut off.
3) The main menu is always shown on the LCD waiting for the user request (open door / change password).
4) To activate the request the system asks the user for the password.
5) If the inserted password is correct then the request is activated 
 -Open Door: motor takes 15 sec to unlock the Door, then the door is opened for 3 seconds and then the motor will take 15 sec to lock the door again.
 -Change password : requires the user to enter the new password twice to save it .
6) If the user inserted the password 3 consecutive wrong times the alarm mode âš  ðŸ“¢ is activated for 60 sec and the keypad will be blocked during this time 
    then the system returns to the main menu again waiting for a request.
 
Project Specifications :
Two atmega32 microcontrollers (HMI_ ECU & Control_ECU) with frequency 8 Mhz.
1) HMI: is just responsible for interaction with the user just take inputs through keypad and display messages on the LCD.
2) Control_ECU: is responsible for all the processing and decisions in the system like password checking, open the door and activate the system alarm.

The project is implemented based on Layered architectured model as follows:
a) HMI_ECU
1- Application layer.
2- HAL: Keypad , LCD.
3- MCAL: GPIO , UART , Timer1.

b) Control_ECU
1- Application layer.
2- HAL: External_EEPROM , DC-Motor , Buzzer.
3- MCAL: GPIO , UART , Timer0(PWM) , Timer1 , TWI(I2C).
